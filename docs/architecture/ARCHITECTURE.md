## Orchestrator Service - Domain Driven Design (DDD)

The orchestrator service has been completely refactored to follow **Domain-Driven Design** principles with **7 bounded contexts**:

```

## Common patterns
- FastAPI + shared middleware (request id, metrics)
- Standard health endpoints and success/error envelopes
- Service discovery via Orchestrator registry (selected services self-register)
- **CLI Service**: Mixin-based architecture with 18+ standardized managers (100% test coverage)
- Tests organized per-service under `tests/unit/<service>`

## Envelopes
- Success envelope: `{ "success": true, "data": {...}, "message": "...", "request_id": "..." }`
- Error envelope: `{ "success": false, "error_code": "...", "details": {...}, "request_id": "..." }`

## Key responsibilities

### Core Services
- **CLI Service**: Interactive TUI with 18+ specialized managers for service operations
- Interpreter: intent recognition and workflow creation
- Prompt Store: prompt CRUD, A/B testing, analytics
- Analysis Service: consistency checks, reports
- Doc Store: content, analyses, search, quality
- Source Agent: ingest and normalization from GitHub/Jira/Confluence
- Secure Analyzer + Summarizer Hub: policy-aware summarization
- Code Analyzer: code endpoint detection and examples
- Log Collector: centralized logs and stats

### Orchestrator Service (DDD Architecture)
The orchestrator service now follows DDD with specialized bounded contexts:

- **🎯 Workflow Management**: Workflow orchestration, execution tracking, and lifecycle management
- **🔍 Service Registry**: Dynamic service discovery, registration, and health monitoring
- **🏥 Health Monitoring**: System health checks, metrics collection, and service monitoring
- **⚙️ Infrastructure**: Distributed transactions (sagas), event streaming, DLQ management, and tracing
- **📥 Ingestion**: Multi-source data ingestion pipelines and workflow management
- **❓ Query Processing**: Natural language query interpretation and execution
- **📊 Reporting**: Analytics report generation and performance metrics

## Observability
- **Health Endpoints**:
  - `/health` - Basic health check
  - `/api/v1/health/system` - Comprehensive system health (Orchestrator)
  - `/api/v1/health/services` - Service registry health (Orchestrator)
  - `/ready` - Readiness probes (some services)
- **Metrics/Logging**: middleware + optional external backends
- **API Documentation**: Swagger UI at `/docs` for all services

## Data flow examples
- Analyze query
  1) CLI/Frontend → Interpreter `/interpret`
  2) Interpreter creates workflow → Orchestrator/Analysis/Doc Store as needed
- Prompt retrieval
  - Services/CLI → Prompt Store `/prompts/search/{category}/{name}`

## Configuration
- Centralized helpers in `services/shared` (config, clients, constants)
- Prefer env and YAML-based defaults where available
