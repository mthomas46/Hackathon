# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that document important architectural decisions made for the LLM Documentation Ecosystem.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records capture significant architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They serve as:

- **Historical Record**: Documenting why certain decisions were made
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Helping new team members understand the rationale
- **Future Reference**: Providing context for future architectural changes

## Current ADRs
