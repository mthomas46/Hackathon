# üîç Failing Services Analysis Report

## üìä Summary of Failed Services

### **Services with Exit Code 1 (Critical Errors)**
| Service | Issue Type | Root Cause |
|---------|------------|------------|
| `analysis-service` | Import Error | Complex DDD relative imports |
| `github-mcp` | Import Error | Missing `services` module path |
| `source-agent` | Import Error | Missing `services` module path |
| `frontend` | Import Error | Missing `services` module path |
| `architecture-digitizer` | Import Error | Missing `services` module path |
| `log-collector` | Import Error | Missing `services` module path |

### **Services with Exit Code 0 (Task Completion)**
| Service | Status | Analysis |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `summarizer-hub` | Completed | Built successfully, may be task-based |
| `code-analyzer` | Completed | "Peer review enhancement dependencies not available" - missing deps |

### **Unhealthy but Running Services**
| Service | Issue | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `doc_store` | Slow health check | Functional but health check timeout |

## üîß Issue Categories & Solutions

### **1. Import Path Issues (6 services)**

**Problem**: Services using old Docker commands that don't maintain proper directory structure.

**Current Problematic Commands**:
```bash
CMD ["python", "github_mcp/main.py"]      # ‚ùå Wrong
CMD ["python", "source_agent/main.py"]    # ‚ùå Wrong  
CMD ["python", "frontend/main.py"]        # ‚ùå Wrong
```

**Root Cause**: These services are copied without the `services/` directory structure, so they can't import from `services.shared.*`.

**Solution**: Standardize these services with our proven pattern:
```dockerfile
# Copy maintaining directory structure
COPY services/github-mcp/ ./services/github_mcp/
COPY services/shared/ ./services/shared/

# Use module-based command
CMD ["python", "-m", "services.github_mcp.main"]
```

### **2. Complex Architecture Issue (1 service)**

**Service**: `analysis-service`
**Problem**: DDD architecture with complex relative imports doesn't work with standard containerization.
**Current Status**: Wrapper script created but still failing.

**Options**:
1. **Continue refining wrapper script**
2. **Simplify the service's import structure**  
3. **Create a specialized container approach**

### **3. Missing Dependencies (1 service)**

**Service**: `code-analyzer`
**Problem**: Missing "peer review enhancement dependencies"
**Status**: Exits cleanly (code 0) but doesn't stay running

### **4. Health Check Timeout (1 service)**

**Service**: `doc_store`
**Problem**: Health check times out but service is functional
**Impact**: Low - service works but shows as unhealthy

## üéØ Recommended Fix Priority

### **Priority 1: Quick Wins (6 services)**
Standardize the import path issues for:
1. `github-mcp` 
2. `source-agent`
3. `frontend`
4. `architecture-digitizer`
5. `log-collector`

**Expected Time**: 15-20 minutes
**Success Rate**: High (proven pattern)

### **Priority 2: Dependency Issues**
1. Fix `code-analyzer` missing dependencies
2. Improve `doc_store` health check timeout

### **Priority 3: Complex Architecture**
1. Resolve `analysis-service` DDD import issues

---

## üìã Detailed Fix Plan

### **Step 1: Standardize Import Path Services**

For each service (`github-mcp`, `source-agent`, `frontend`, `architecture-digitizer`, `log-collector`):

1. **Update Dockerfile**:
   ```dockerfile
   # Copy maintaining directory structure  
   COPY services/[SERVICE-NAME]/ ./services/[service_name]/
   COPY services/shared/ ./services/shared/
   
   # Use proper module import
   CMD ["python", "-m", "services.[service_name].main"]
   ```

2. **Handle naming conflicts** (hyphen vs underscore)
3. **Add missing dependencies** as needed

### **Step 2: Test Each Service**
- Build and start each service individually  
- Verify health endpoints
- Check logs for any remaining issues

### **Step 3: Address Remaining Issues**
- Investigate `code-analyzer` dependencies
- Optimize `doc_store` health check
- Continue work on `analysis-service` if needed

## üí° Expected Outcomes

After implementing these fixes:

- **Current**: 11 containers, 10 healthy (91% success)
- **Projected**: 17 containers, 15+ healthy (88%+ success)  
- **Additional Services**: +6 working services
- **Ecosystem Completeness**: Near 100% service availability

---

## üöÄ Implementation Commands

Quick fix commands for the standardization:

```bash
# Fix GitHub MCP
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build github-mcp
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d github-mcp

# Fix Source Agent  
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build source-agent
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d source-agent

# Continue for other services...
```

This systematic approach will bring the ecosystem to near-complete operational status! üéØ
