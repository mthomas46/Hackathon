# Doc Store

Navigation: [Home](../../README.md) 路 [Architecture](../../docs/architecture/) 路 [Testing](../../docs/guides/TESTING_GUIDE.md) 路 [Services](../README_SERVICES.md)

Tests: [tests/unit/doc_store](../../tests/unit/doc_store)

## Key Features
- SQLite-backed store with FTS5 for document search and semantic fallback.
- Advanced analytics and insights with storage trends, quality metrics, and temporal analysis.
- Enhanced search with filtering, faceting, sorting, and metadata-based queries.
- Quality scoring (stale, redundant, low_views, missing_owner) and list APIs.
- Enveloped write endpoint `/documents/enveloped` and standard `/documents`.
- `/search`, `/search/advanced`, `/analytics`, `/analytics/summary`, `/documents/_list`, `/documents/quality`, `/info`, `/metrics`.

## Goal
- Persist documents and LLM/code analyses for deep and ensemble comparisons.
- Provide caching by content_hash/prompt/model and attach correlation metadata.

## Overview and role in the ecosystem
- System of record for content, analyses, and ensemble results.
- Powers search and quality signals for downstream services and UI.

## Storage
- Default: SQLite (file `services/doc-store/db.sqlite3`). Easy to swap for Postgres later.
- Tables:
  - documents(id, content, content_hash, metadata, created_at)
  - analyses(id, document_id, analyzer, model, prompt_hash, result, score, metadata, created_at)
  - ensembles(id, document_id, config, results, analysis, created_at)
- Indices for performance: content_hash (documents), document_id/prompt_hash/created_at (analyses).

### Postgres migration (suggested)
- Replace SQLite with Postgres by:
  - Running a Postgres container and providing `DOCSTORE_DB=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname`
  - Using an async driver (e.g., `asyncpg` + SQLAlchemy) and migrating table creation.
  - Adding proper migrations (Alembic) for schema evolution.

## Testing
- Unit tests: [tests/unit/doc_store](../../tests/unit/doc_store)
- Strategies:
  - Flexible assertions for success envelopes vs direct data
  - Handle `/documents/_list` vs nested `data.items` responses in mocks
  - FTS `/search` results presence rather than exact IDs in all scenarios

## Analytics & Insights

The doc-store provides comprehensive analytics capabilities to understand document storage patterns, quality trends, and ecosystem usage:

### Analytics Endpoints
- **GET /analytics**: Detailed analytics with configurable time periods
  - Storage statistics (size, compression, distribution)
  - Quality metrics (analysis coverage, staleness, model performance)
  - Temporal trends (creation rates, analysis patterns)
  - Content insights (duplication, source distribution, most analyzed documents)
  - Relationship insights (analysis coverage, collaboration patterns)

- **GET /analytics/summary**: High-level summary with key insights and recommendations
  - Executive summary of storage and quality metrics
  - Automated insights based on patterns and trends
  - Actionable recommendations for optimization

### Advanced Search
