- üîÑ Lifecycle Management: Database schema and core logic implemented
- ‚è≥ Real-Time Notifications: Planned

## Activity Log

### September 16, 2025 - Performance Caching & Relationship Graph Implementation

#### Performance Caching System ‚úÖ
- **Redis Integration**: High-performance distributed caching with configurable memory limits
- **Intelligent Invalidation**: Tag-based cache invalidation for data consistency
- **Performance Monitoring**: Hit rates, response times, memory usage tracking
- **Fallback Support**: Local caching when Redis unavailable
- **Management Endpoints**: Stats, invalidation, warmup, and optimization

**Technical Implementation:**
- Multi-level caching (Redis + local fallback)
- Cache key generation with deterministic hashing
- Size tracking and memory management
- Response time monitoring and statistics
- Tag-based selective invalidation

#### Relationship Graph System ‚úÖ
- **Automatic Relationship Extraction**: Content pattern matching and metadata analysis
- **Graph Database Schema**: document_relationships table with strength scoring
- **Graph Traversal**: Path finding algorithms between documents
- **Relationship Types**: references, derived_from, correlated, analyzed_by, external_reference
- **Graph Statistics**: Connectivity analysis, density metrics, component analysis

**Technical Implementation:**
- RelationshipExtractor class with pattern matching
- RelationshipGraph class with traversal algorithms
- Database integration with proper indexing
- API endpoints for relationship management
- CLI integration for graph exploration

#### Semantic Tagging Foundation üîÑ
- **Database Schema**: document_tags, semantic_metadata, tag_taxonomy tables
- **Taxonomy Management**: Hierarchical tag organization with synonyms
- **Metadata Extraction**: Position-aware entity recognition
- **Tag Confidence Scoring**: Weighted tagging with confidence metrics

**Current Progress:**
- Database tables and indexes created
- Basic tag extraction framework established
- Taxonomy management structure in place

## Major Achievements

### Performance Caching System

### Semantic Tagging Framework (Foundation)
- **Metadata Extraction**: Structured approach to semantic content analysis
- **Taxonomy System**: Hierarchical tag organization and management
- **Confidence Scoring**: Weighted tagging with quality metrics

### Lifecycle Management System (Foundation) üîÑ
- **Database Schema**: lifecycle_policies, document_lifecycle, lifecycle_events tables
- **Policy Engine**: Automated policy evaluation and application based on document characteristics
- **Lifecycle Phases**: active ‚Üí archived ‚Üí deleted with configurable retention periods
- **Compliance Tracking**: Audit trails and compliance status monitoring
- **Automated Transitions**: Scheduled processing for archival and deletion

**Technical Implementation:**
- Policy matching based on content type, source type, age, tags, and analysis status
- Retention period calculation with policy priority handling
- Event logging for all lifecycle transitions and policy applications
- Compliance monitoring and reporting capabilities
- Database indexes for performance optimization

## Technical Highlights
- **Multi-Level Caching**: Redis + local with intelligent fallbacks
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS/DFS path finding with configurable depth limits
- **Relationship Pattern Matching**: Regex-based automatic relationship discovery
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time cache statistics and optimization
- **Database Optimization**: Comprehensive indexing for all new features

## Quality Assurance
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling throughout all new systems
