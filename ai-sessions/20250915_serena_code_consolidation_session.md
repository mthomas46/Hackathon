# Serena Session: Code Consolidation Wave

- Session ID: 20250915
- Date: 2025-09-15
- Owner: Serena
- Repository: Hackathon

## Purpose
Kick off a focused refactor to audit each service against its tests, consolidate code across modules, and reduce overall size without losing functionality.

## Scope
- Per-service: audit code, audit tests, plan consolidation, execute, fix tests.
- No boilerplate; favor deletion, dedupe, and shared utilities.

## Goals (Today)
- Establish session context and tracking.
- Choose first service and capture pre-refactor state.
- Draft consolidation plan grounded in passing tests.

## Initial Plan
1. Orchestrator: scan code/test layout and note duplication.
2. Define minimal edits to remove duplication and reduce complexity.
3. Run tests; address regressions quickly.

## Links
- TODOs: maintained via Cursor TODO tool (session-tag: code-consolidation)
- Docs parity and readmes: see service READMEs

## Activity Log
- 2025-09-15 18:20:21: Session created. Goals and plan documented.
