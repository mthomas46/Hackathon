- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Unit test infrastructure

### Authentication Management

**Session**: `20250913-authentication-removal-implementation.md`

- **Scope**: Remove authentication requirements from all API endpoints
- **Rationale**: API endpoints designed to be public, no auth required
- **Changes**:
  - Removed auth-middleware from confluence routes
  - Updated unit tests to remove auth-related mocks
  - Cleaned up configuration files
  - Updated project documentation

### Service Layer Testing

**Session**: `20250913-comprehensive-unit-testing-services-implementation.md`

  - Comprehensive error handling scenarios

### Data Persistence Issues

**Session**: `20250913-mongodb-document-insertion-fix-and-session-management.md`

- **Problem**: Converted documents not being inserted when confluencePageId doesn't exist
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect session management logic preventing new conversions
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed session reuse logic to allow sequential conversions
  - Maintained unique constraint on confluencePageId in converted_documents
  - Allowed multiple processing_log records per confluencePageId for job tracking

### Duplicate Prevention

**Session**: `20250913-confluence-duplicate-prevention.md`

- **Problem**: Duplicate documents with same confluencePageId being created
- **Solution**: Implemented upsert operation using findOneAndUpdate with upsert: true
- **Result**: Update existing documents instead of creating duplicates

### API Expansion

**Session**: `20250913-documents-api-endpoints-implementation-and-cleanup.md`

- **Scope**: Add new endpoints for document management
