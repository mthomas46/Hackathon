# Development Timeline

## Development Timeline

### Initial Foundation (September 12, 2025)

**Session**: `20250912-complete-application-build-and-testing-analysis.md`

- **Scope**: Complete application creation from empty workspace
- **Deliverables**: Full production-ready Express.js + TypeScript application
- **Key Components Built**:
  - MongoDB integration with Mongoose ODM
  - Comprehensive test suite (14/14 tests passing)
  - Docker containerization
  - ESLint/Prettier code quality tools
  - Complete MVC architecture with proper separation of concerns

**Technical Achievements**:

- Package.json with all dependencies and scripts
- TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- Express application with middleware pipeline
- MongoDB models (ProcessingLog, ConvertedDocument)
- Service classes (ConfluenceService, MarkdownConversionService, etc.)
- HTTP controllers and route definitions
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Unit test infrastructure

### Authentication Management

**Session**: `20250913-authentication-removal-implementation.md`

- **Scope**: Remove authentication requirements from all API endpoints
- **Rationale**: API endpoints designed to be public, no auth required
- **Changes**:
  - Removed auth-middleware from confluence routes
  - Updated unit tests to remove auth-related mocks
  - Cleaned up configuration files
  - Updated project documentation

### Service Layer Testing

**Session**: `20250913-comprehensive-unit-testing-services-implementation.md`

- **Scope**: Create comprehensive unit tests for ProcessingLogService and ConversionService
- **Achievements**:
  - 25 test cases covering all public methods
  - 100% code coverage (statements, branches, functions, lines)
  - Sophisticated mocking for dependencies
  - Type-safe mocks using Jest's Mocked types
  - Comprehensive error handling scenarios

### Data Persistence Issues

**Session**: `20250913-mongodb-document-insertion-fix-and-session-management.md`

- **Problem**: Converted documents not being inserted when confluencePageId doesn't exist
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect session management logic preventing new conversions
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed session reuse logic to allow sequential conversions
  - Maintained unique constraint on confluencePageId in converted_documents
  - Allowed multiple processing_log records per confluencePageId for job tracking

### Duplicate Prevention

**Session**: `20250913-confluence-duplicate-prevention.md`

- **Problem**: Duplicate documents with same confluencePageId being created
- **Solution**: Implemented upsert operation using findOneAndUpdate with upsert: true
- **Result**: Update existing documents instead of creating duplicates

### API Expansion

**Session**: `20250913-documents-api-endpoints-implementation-and-cleanup.md`

- **Scope**: Add new endpoints for document management
- **New Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/v1/confluence/documents/:confluencePageId` - Get single document
  - `GET /api/v1/confluence/documents/:confluencePageId/markdown` - Download markdown file
- **Achievements**: Fixed routing conflicts, cleaned up unused code, maintained 334 passing tests

### Database Testing & Connection Management

**Session**: `20250913-database-connection-test-fixes-and-cleanup.md`

- **Scope**: Fix database connection tests and cleanup
- **Issues Resolved**: Connection management, test isolation, cleanup procedures

### Authentication Protocol Fixes

**Session**: `20250913-confluence-auth-fix-bearer-to-basic.md`

- **Problem**: Confluence API authentication using Bearer instead of Basic
- **Solution**: Updated ConfluenceService to use Basic authentication with username/API token
