  - Health checks for all HTTP services
  - Proper volume and environment management

### 3. Fixed Port Conflicts ‚úÖ

- Proper port mappings configured in docker-compose
- External and internal port separation where needed

### 4. Fixed Library Dependencies ‚úÖ
- Resolved `aioredis` import issues in shared modules
- Updated type annotations for flexibility
- Comprehensive requirements files covering all service needs

### 5. Fixed Service Dependencies ‚úÖ 
- Configured proper `depends_on` relationships in docker-compose
- Redis as foundation dependency for core services
- Orchestrator as coordination service for AI services

### 6. Fixed Import Path Issues ‚úÖ
- Updated Dockerfiles to maintain proper `services.` module structure
- Used `python -m services.module.main` syntax for relative imports
- Proper PYTHONPATH configuration in all containers

### 7. Fixed Port Mapping Mismatches ‚úÖ
- Doc Store: Fixed 5087:5010 mapping to match internal configuration
- All other services have correct 1:1 port mappings

### 8. All Services Successfully Tested ‚úÖ
- Individual service testing completed
- Full ecosystem testing completed
- Health endpoint verification successful

## üöÄ Usage Commands

### Start Core Services
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --profile core up -d
```

### Start All Services
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --profile core --profile ai_services --profile development --profile production --profile tooling up -d
```

### Individual Service Testing
```bash
# Test individual services
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d redis orchestrator
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d doc_store
curl http://localhost:5099/health  # Orchestrator
curl http://localhost:5087/health  # Doc Store
```

### Full Integration Testing
```bash
# Use the comprehensive test script
python scripts/integration/comprehensive_docker_test.py --all
```

## üìä Health Check Results

**‚úÖ All Critical Services Healthy:**
- Redis: `PONG` response
- Orchestrator: HTTP 200 with health JSON
- Doc Store: HTTP 200 with health JSON

**Sample Health Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "orchestrator", 
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-17T19:55:03.245824Z",
  "uptime_seconds": 49.702491,
  "environment": "development"
}
```

## üîß Technical Improvements Made

### Docker Best Practices
- Multi-stage builds for dependency management
- Non-root user security implementation
- Proper health checks with realistic timeouts
- Minimal base images (Python 3.12-slim)
- Layer caching optimization

### Dependency Management
- Centralized shared requirements
- Service-specific requirements where needed
- Version pinning for stability
- Development vs production dependency separation

### Import Resolution
- Maintained proper Python module structure
- Fixed relative import issues
- Proper PYTHONPATH configuration
- Module-based execution for relative imports

### Network and Security
- Service isolation within Docker network
- Non-conflicting port assignments
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Proper volume mounting for persistent data

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment**: Services are ready for production deployment
2. **Monitoring**: Health endpoints available for monitoring integration
3. **Scaling**: Individual services can be scaled as needed
4. **CI/CD**: Dockerfiles ready for automated build pipelines

All services can now run reliably in Docker containers with proper dependency resolution, health monitoring, and network isolation! üéâ
